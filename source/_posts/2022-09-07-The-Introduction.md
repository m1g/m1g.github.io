> Being around my grandfather's Tandy 1000 may have been foreshadowing that my future would be digital

**I'm a Software Engineer** who specializes in React and enjoys developing creative UI solutions. In my day-to-day, I'm building and shipping components and services that'll get the job done. In my downtime, I'm raising some pretty cool kids and channeling my energy into building bridges not barriers. I cool out to great podcasts, solid documentaries, cultural festivals, and helping others level-up in their React skills

### Why blog?

I've needed a space to share my ideas and approaches to the many complications that life throws at us. And I'm hoping that it reflects my own personal work-life balance. Sure it's a space for my voice, but more importantly I'd like for this space to contribute to much larger conversations.

### Who are you?

I'm a father to some cool kids, a husband to a really chill wife, a Marvel stan, Miami Heat fan, and give me the boom bap Hip-hop or leave me out of it. I get down with Javascript, React, NextJs, and a _little_ Jekyll and Rails. As of late, I've been more focused on frontend architecture. And I'm a fan of a solid development process with heavy documentation. I've had many roles in my travels and found that teamwork really does make the dream work. And AFK.. I enjoy learning new things, watching a documentary or a good series, reading articles and listening to podcasts, and spending time outdoors with family and good friends ‚úåüèæ
